You need some Youtube API Keys. I have gotten some from debugging http://livecounts.net.

After you get your API keys, place all of them in a file called "keys" without quotation marks

It only has to be the keys, no quotation marks or ticks.

For a working version, click [Youtube Live Counter](http://pur1st.x10.bz/ytcount/index.html).

Note: This does not work if you download it, then open it. You need a webserver to do so.
